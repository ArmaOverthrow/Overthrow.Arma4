## Describe your requested feature
Describe your feature request. What does it do exactly, how does it work. Go into detail.

**Example**
> Add a 'restart save' button to the pause menu. Pressing this button would give a confirmation / warning prompt 'Are you sure, this process is irreversible', in which pressing 'Yes' would delete the current save and restart.

## Does the feature fix a problem?
Would adding this feature fix a problem or a flaw that's currently present?

**Example**
> Adding this feature removes the need to manually delete the .db folder, which makes restarting tedious.
