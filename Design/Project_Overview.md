# Overthrow - Project Overview

## What is Overthrow?

Overthrow is a dynamic and persistent revolution platform for Arma Reforger (and eventually Arma 4). It transforms the traditional military simulation experience into an asymmetric resistance warfare scenario where players work to liberate their homeland from occupying forces.

## Core Concept

Players take on the role of resistance fighters in an occupied territory, starting with limited resources and gradually building a liberation movement. The game emphasizes guerrilla warfare tactics, civilian interaction, resource management, and strategic territory control rather than conventional military operations.

## Key Gameplay Features

### Persistent World
- **Save System**: Game state persists between sessions using the Enfusion Persistence Framework (EPF)
- **Dynamic Events**: The world continues to evolve based on player actions and AI behaviors
- **Consequences**: Player decisions have lasting impacts on the game world

### Resistance Operations
- **Guerrilla Warfare**: Players engage in hit-and-run tactics against occupying forces
- **Base Building**: Establish Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) and resistance camps
- **Resource Management**: Manage money, equipment, and supplies for the resistance
- **Territory Control**: Liberate towns and regions from occupying forces

### Economic System
- **Player Economy**: Earn money through various activities and missions
- **Cost-based Actions**: Most significant actions require financial investment
- **Resource Trading**: Buy and sell equipment, weapons, and supplies
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Economic costs scale with selected difficulty level

### Social Systems
- **Civilian Interaction**: Recruit civilians to join the resistance movement
- **AI Commanding**: Build and command squads of AI resistance fighters
- **Faction Relationships**: Navigate complex relationships between resistance, occupying forces, and civilians
- **Real Estate**: Own and manage properties for safe houses and operations

### Building and Placement
- **Placeable System**: Deploy various structures, defenses, and equipment
- **Location Restrictions**: Strategic placement rules based on proximity to towns, bases, and other structures
- **Cost Management**: All placements require resources and strategic planning
- **Randomization Options**: Some placeables can randomize their appearance for variety

### World Interaction
- **Town System**: Each settlement has unique characteristics, population, and strategic value
- **Base Assault**: Plan and execute attacks on enemy installations
- **Vehicle Operations**: Acquire, maintain, and deploy various vehicles
- **Equipment Management**: Sophisticated loadout and inventory systems

## Getting Started

### Basic Controls
- **Overthrow Menu**: Press "U" (not "Y") to open the main Overthrow interface
- **Context Actions**: Use mouse interactions for most in-world actions
- **Placement Mode**: Enter placement mode to deploy structures and equipment

### Early Game Progression
1. **Learn the Interface**: Familiarize yourself with the Overthrow menu system
2. **Explore the World**: Understand town locations, enemy bases, and strategic positions

4. **Establish Presence**: Create your first safe house or small outpost
5. **Build Networks**: Begin recruiting civilians and building resistance cells
6. **Plan Operations**: Identify high-value targets and plan your first major operation

### Strategic Considerations
- **Start Small**: Begin with low-risk, high-reward activities
- **Location Matters**: Choose base locations carefully considering proximity to towns and enemy forces
- **Resource Conservation**: Manage your limited starting resources wisely
- **Patience**: Build your resistance gradually rather than rushing into major confrontations

## Game Modes
