**Release Date:** July 10th, 2025 (tentative)

This is the **MASSIVE** v1.3 update to Overthrow Reforger, featuring major new systems and significant gameplay improvements.

‚ö†Ô∏è **SAVE COMPATIBILITY:** This update WILL BREAK your existing saves. Server owners should backup saves and consider pinning to v1.2.59 until ready to start fresh.

## üéØ Major New Features

### Undercover System
*(Thanks to scarlett for leading this feature)*

A new clothing-based stealth mechanic that changes how you interact with the occupying faction:

- **New clothing indicator** next to the "eye" icon:
  - ‚ö™ **White (Civilian):** You appear as a civilian; OF won't make you wanted unless you enter restricted areas
  - üî¥ **Red (Hostile):** You appear hostile due to faction gear, weapons, or wanted status; instant wanted if spotted
  - üîµ **Blue (Occupying Faction):** You appear as OF; they won't make you wanted unless you get too close (~15m)

- **Dynamic detection distance** scales with:
  - Difficulty setting
  - Current stealth skill level
  - Visibility conditions (night provides better concealment)

- **Improved feedback:** Notifications now inform you why you were made wanted

### Camp Improvements

- **Fast travel:** All players can now fast travel to any camp
- **Camp management:** Players can "Manage Camp" and set it as private to restrict fast travel access
- **Build system:** Players can now place/build basic items at camps
- **Respawn point:** Any camp can be set as "home" for respawn on death
- **Cleanup:** Placing a new camp deletes your old camp and any built items at the old location

### Mobile FOBs

Revolutionary new FOB system replacing static placement:

- **Mobile FOB trucks** available at civilian vehicle stores or procurement at Garages (~$5000 on normal difficulty)
- **Deploy/Undeploy system:**
  - "Deploy FOB" action on truck rear locks vehicle and erects camo net + flag
  - "Undeploy FOB" transfers nearby Equipment Box contents into truck and removes all built items
- **Flexible placement:** Can be deployed anywhere except near bases, including in towns and near buildings
- **Fast travel & respawn:** Deployed FOBs function as fast travel points and respawn locations
- **Priority FOBs:** Officers can designate "Priority FOBs" with special map icons visible at all zoom levels
- **Server configuration:** `mobileFOBOfficersOnly: true` option restricts purchase/deployment to officers only

- **Street recruitment:** Recruit civilians directly for money
- **Recruitment Tent:** Build at FOBs/Bases to recruit cheaper using supporter populations from nearby towns

- **Loadout manager:** Complete loadout system in Equipment Boxes:

  - Load saved loadouts onto yourself or nearby recruits
  - Persistent loadout storage

### Enhanced Inventory Transfers

- **Robust operations:** All inventory transfers (load, unload, undeploy FOB, loot into vehicle) now use progress dialogs
- **Console stability:** Looting into trucks no longer crashes console players
- **Smart filtering:** Looting now excludes clothing items (vests, helmets, backpacks) - grab manually if needed
- **Improved accessibility:** "Loot" action added to truck rear for better visibility

## üöó Vehicle & Combat Systems

### Vehicle Patrols (AI Driving)
- **Two patrol levels:** Light and heavy vehicle patrols

- **Safe positioning:** Vehicle patrols use defined safe spawn positions

### Town Patrols
- **Persistent presence:** OF now patrols all towns from game start
- **Scaling system:** Patrol size scales with difficulty and town size
