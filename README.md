# Overthrow
A dynamic and persistent revolution platform for Arma Reforger (and eventually Arma 4)

## Installing
Overthrow is available in early access from the ARMA Reforger Workshop. Just search for "Overthrow".

## Playing
The key to open the Overthrow menu is "U" (not "Y" due to key binding conflicts in Arma Reforger). 

## Development

### For New Developers
Complete development setup instructions are available in our comprehensive documentation:

ðŸ“š **[Development Documentation](https://wiki.armaoverthrow.com/en/development-documentation)**

Key resources:
- **[Environment Setup Guide](https://wiki.armaoverthrow.com/en/development-documentation/development-environment-setup)** - Complete setup walkthrough
- **[Architecture Guide](https://wiki.armaoverthrow.com/en/development-documentation/architecture)** - Understanding Overthrow's component system
- **[Coding Standards](https://wiki.armaoverthrow.com/en/development-documentation/coding-standards)** - EnforceScript conventions
- **[Development Workflow](https://wiki.armaoverthrow.com/en/development-documentation/development-workflow)** - Testing and compilation procedures

### Quick Start
1. Clone this repository using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (recommended)
2. Install "Arma Reforger Tools" from Steam (under Tools section)
