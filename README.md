# Overthrow
A dynamic and persistent revolution platform for Arma Reforger (and eventually Arma 4)

Read the [Wiki](https://github.com/ArmaOverthrow/Overthrow.Arma4/wiki) for ideas and concepts planned.

## Installing
Overthrow is not yet available in the Reforger workshop, but you are able to follow along with early development, help test or even create it by using this github

Start by cloning or downloading this Github repository. For Windows/MacOS we recommend using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). 
 - [Installing Github Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop)
 - [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
1. Install the "Arma Reforger Tools" in Steam. Find it by switching from "Games" to "Tools" in your Steam library.
1. Run the Arma Reforger Tools and click "Add Existing"
1. Navigate to the folder you cloned the Overthrow Github into and select `addon.gproj`
1. Double click on the Overthrow mod to open it in the Workbench
1. Double click on `Overthrow/Worlds/MP/OVT_Campaign_Eden.ent` in the Enfusion Workbench resource browser
1. In the World Editor that opens, click on the Green Play button or press F5

## Updating
Updates will be pushed to github often (sometimes multiple times a day). 

1. Sign up and/or sign in to Github. [See Github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account)
1. "Watch" this repository in the top right to get email notifications when updates are made
1. Before updating Overthrow, exit game mode in World Editor
1. In Github Desktop, make sure "Current Repository" top left is this one
1. Click "Fetch Origin" and then "Pull Remote"

## Playing
The key to open the Overthrow menu is not "Y", its now "U" (due to key binding conflicts in Arma Reforger). But there really isnt much to do just yet. This section will update with more info as features are implemented and the wiki will start to be filled out.

## Contributing
Just [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/j6CvmFfZ95) and participate in the `#overthrow-reforger` channel. Report any bugs you find or join the discussion about features or suggest your own.
